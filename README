2. Make sure you have Rust installed on your system.
3. Compile the program using `rustc main.rs`.
4. Run the executable generated (`main.exe` on Windows, `main` on Unix-based systems).
5. Enter the operation to perform in the format: `operator operand1 operand2`.
6. Press Enter to see the result.

### Example Input
